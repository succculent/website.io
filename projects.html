			<h2>Hardware Sound Re-Synthesizer </h2>
			<p>
				Synthesis and synthesizers are extremely powerful tools for music production and for the music industry, but have steep uphill learning curves. 
				This project is a means of making synthesis faster and more accessible. 
				Using Raspberry Pi technology, Maximillian C++ Library, and Machine Learning, we are developing a full fledged, industry ready hardware synthesizer which is able to recreate any given sample in the bounds of the synthesizer. 
				I am leading the project with funding and resources provided by the Ahmanson Lab at USC. 
				Track progress on the project with our
				<a href="https://github.com/succculent/resynth">GitHub</a>.
				We hope to have a kickstarter for this project soon, stay tuned if you are interested!

			<h2>Sample Generator</h2>
			<p>
				The use of samples within music production has skyrocketed since the invention of samplers and it's incorporation into Hip-Hop. 
				Samples speed up the production process allowing for musicians to find and follow inspiration to the end of the song without losing it synthesizing every sound they use. 
				Because of this, the quality and uniqueness of music production is often defined by the samples a musician uses. 
				Unique Samples are
				<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) Hard to find, giving musicians with more connections an advantage
				<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) Expensive, giving well established musicians an advantage
				<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(3) Conditional, if the musician can buy and learn expensive synthesizer software or hardware
				<br>We are building an algorithm to create unique samples for use in music production. 
				Using Tensorflow Keras and Python, we developed an encoder decoder model to recreate samples; 
				we are now using this model to combine embeddings of different samples to generate a new sample. 
				I am leading this project with a team from the USC Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS++).

			<h2>Pantea</h2>
			<p>
				With the recent outbreak of the Corona Virus, people everywhere in the word have been struggling to access medical resources they need. 
				We wanted to tackle this problem specifically for natural disasters and other events which bottleneck access to resources.
				Pantea is a livestreaming and diagnostic web tool.
				Users can check to see what disease or injury their symptoms may suggest using our computer vision and questionare diagnosis tool.
				Once they have been diagnosed, they will be directed towards a hub of resources such as articles, videos, and live-streams about their diagnosis and what they can do for immediate attention.
				The livestreaming was set up in a swift application in which doctors can scan a QR code on the website and immedietaly begin streaming. 
				We also added a data tracking feature which helps collect information about natural disasters and disease outbreaks to optimize where resources are sent.
				Our project created a working prototype using OpenAI API, Mux API, Swift, and Node.js. 
				This project was submitted to Hack SC 2020.

				<a href="https://devpost.com/software/pantea">Devpost</a> or our

			<h2>Juicy Apple</h2>
			<p>
				The food industry uses enormous amounts of natural resources and money shipping rotten fruit using expensive, cooled, transportation methods. 
				These rotten fruits get thrown away when they arrive at a consumer-facing store.
				Sorting fruit earlier in the supply chain would significantly reduce carbon emissions to transport produce.
				We developed a program to detect rotten fruit in realtime and give the coordinates to the fruit allowing for automation of rotten fruit removal much earlier in the supply chain. 
				Our project created a working prototype using Google Cloud Vision as well as GCP Image Detection and Classification models. 
				This project won the iTradeNetwork award at LA Hacks Hackathon 2019.

			<h2>E-LEAP-Ments</h2>
			<p>
				The games industry is constantly looking for new ways to interact with the user in a more engaging and exciting way. 
				LEAPmotion technology was developed to improve both human computer interactions and increase access to these interactions through cheaper technology.
				This technology unfortunetaly is not breaking through in the game industry.
				We realized the potential it has for creating very unique and engaging games.
				E-LEAP-Ments is a puzzle game with an idea similar to code breaker, except you are also battling an enemy. 
				Master the elements and find the correct order of moves before your AI opponent to win as fast as possible.
				Our two greatest achievements in this project were
				<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(1) the integration of the LEAP-motion api within both Unity and our reinforcement learning AI and
				<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(2) the development of a reinforcement learning AI opponent which begins at 0 knowledge and learns at the rate at which the user is learning.
				This project won the Twillio award at SB Hacks V in 2019.
